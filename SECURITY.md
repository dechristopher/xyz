# Security Policy

While XYZ's security footprint isn't very large, we do take it seriously. If you
find there are any vulnerable library versions or holes in our configuration
checks that could impact a user's system or servers, please let us know.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.3+  | :white_check_mark: |
| <0.0.3  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email one of our maintainers directly using contact information found in their
profiles. Prioritize Andrew DeChristopher <me@dchr.host>. For non-critical issues,
please just open an issue or a PR with a fix and we'll be right on it.
